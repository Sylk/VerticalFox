**I'm only working on compatability with the latest stable release of Firefox, if you find any flaws, please update your browser first.**


*The auto hide also works on Tree Style Tabs, but you may need to adjust the css to achieve the best look.*

## How to apply

1. You need to have [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/) installed.
2. Download the files in release according to your operation system. You can also directly use the source files you need.
3. If you haven't customized your Firefox before, check out [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/wiki/userchrome/) for how to set up your Firefox and the profiles. TL;DR version:

   1. Navigate to `about:config` in the address bar and accept the risks.
   2. Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and toggle it to true (by double clicking on it).
   3. Navigate to `about:support` in the address bar, under **Application Basics**, find **Profile Directory** and open it. You should now see your profile directory.
   4. Inside your profile directory, create a new folder named `chrome` (all lower case).
4. Once you have your `chrome` folder under your profile directory, copy the `userChrome.css` you downloaded into `chrome`. Alternatively you can create a blank `userChrome.css` and paste the code. Restart your browser.
5. Go to the settings of Sidebery, go to **Styles editor**, paste all the code from `sidebery_styles.css`.
